## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on various physicochemical properties using supervised machine learning models. The red wine dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).

The classification task helps identify the quality of wine on a scale (typically 0–10) based on parameters like acidity, alcohol, pH, etc.

## Models Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

---

## Key Features & Techniques

- Implemented multiple classifiers and compared their performance.
- Utilized **GridSearchCV** to optimize SVM hyperparameters.
  - Achieved an accuracy improvement from **87% to 90%** through tuning.
- Employed **10-fold Cross Validation** to evaluate generalization performance.
- Achieved:
  - **Accuracy**: 91.1%
  - **F1-Score**: 60%
